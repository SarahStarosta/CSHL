<p> CellBase was developed at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (1 Bungtown Road, Cold Spring Harbor, New York 11724, United States) in the laboratories of Drs Zachary F. Mainen and Adam Kepecs. Core programing was performed by Adam Kepecs. Additional development was carried out by Zachary F Mainen, Ranade Sachin, Balazs Hangya among other members of the Kepecs lab. The documentation was written by Balazs Hangya.
</p>

<p>The purpose of CellBase is to provide a Matlab (Mathworks Inc.) based data manager system for efficient handling of single cell and behavioral data organized into recording/behavioral sessions. Data analysis and plotting functionalities can be added on to the core data base manager functions. This system supports customized data analysis schemes helping easy computation of routine analysis procedures while maintining compatibility among different data sets within or across labs.
