<align="left">Auto-correlation.
<h2>Description</h2>
<p><tt>acg</tt> calculates auto-correlations. Window size is set to +-500 ms with a 0.5 ms resolution. Maximum 50000 spikes are included to avoid memory problems. Segments are filtered with <tt>findSegs3</tt>. For details on the algorithm, see <tt>xcorr</tt>.</p> 
<p>Three indeces are derived from the auto-correlogram (ACG). Burst index is calculated as the normalized difference between maximum ACG for lags 0-10 ms and mean ACG for lags 180-200 ms. The normalizing factor is the greater of the two numbers, yielding and index between -1 and 1 (see Royer et al., 2012). Theta index is calculated as the normalized difference between mean ACG for a +-25 ms window around the peak within lags 100 and 200 ms and the mean ACG for lags 180-200 and 65-85 ms.
 Normalization is performed similarly as for the burst index. Refractory is calculated as full width half hight of the central gap in the smoothed ACG. Smoothing is performed by a 10 ms moving average.</p>
<p><tt>acg(i)</tt> calls <tt>acg</tt> for cells defined by the cell ID list (or index set
 to <tt>CELLIDLIST,</tt> see CellBase documentation) <tt>i.
</tt> 
<p>Optional input arguments (parameter-value pairs with default values):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><tt>'issave', false</tt> - controls saving behavior; plots and
 auto-correlation matrices are saved only if <tt>'issave'</tt> is set to true</p>
</blockquote>
