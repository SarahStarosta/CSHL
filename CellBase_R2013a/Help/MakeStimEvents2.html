<align="left">Create stimulus events structure.
<h2>Description</h2>
<p><tt>MakeStimEvents2(sessionpath)</tt> constructs and saves stimulus events
 structure ('StimEvents') for the stimulation session in the folder
 <tt>sessionpath.</tt> Stimulation pulses are detected as TTLs recorded by the
 data acquisition system (e.g. Neuralynx) and their number is verified
 by the log file of the stimulation control software. Note however, that
 the recorded TTLs are the exclusive source of stimulus information.
 Note also, that the Neuralynx Event file should first be converted to
 Matlab <tt>.mat</tt> file before <tt>MakeStimEvents2</tt> can run.</p>
<p>Stimulus time stamps (e.g. pulse onset and offset, burst onset and
 offset, protocol start and end), time intervals (e.g. inter-burst
 interval, burst duration, pulse duration), stimulation-related
 statistics (e.g. frequency) are extracted/calculated from the recorded
 TTL time stamps and event strings. The data are loaded in a structure
 and saved under the name 'StimEvents.mat'.</p>
<p>By using the <tt>MakeStimEvents2(sessionpath,parameter1,value1,...)</tt> syntax, 
 the TTLs actually used during the recording as well as the name of
 stimulus protocol file can be specified (default values provided):
<blockquote>
 <p><tt>'BurstStartNttl', 2</tt> - TTL for start of burst stimulation
 (stimulation information sent to Neuralynx as directly 
 executable event string)</p>
 <p><tt>'ProtocolStartNttl', 1</tt> - TTL sent at the beginning of each
 stimulation protocol</p>
 <p><tt>'PulseNttl', 16384</tt> - TTL signalling pulse onset and offset time (TTL split between stimulation device and data acquisition
 system)</p>
 <p><tt>'PulseEventID', 0</tt> - event ID for pulse TTL in the recording system</p>
 <p><tt>'ProtocolList', {'LaserStimProtocol2'; 'BackNForthTask2'}</tt> - names of simulation and behavior protocols; no action is implemented in the current version for behavior protocols.</p>
